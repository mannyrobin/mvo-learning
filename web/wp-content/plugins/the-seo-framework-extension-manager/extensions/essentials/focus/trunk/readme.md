This extension guides you through the process of writing targeted content that ranks with focus keywords, their inflections, and their synonyms.

## Overview

### Focus your content

With over 1 billion competing websites, your pages barely stand a chance ranking on the first page of Google.
So, writing quality content that ranks well in search engines isn't easy. This is where Focus comes in.

This extension helps you to focus your content to a few well-targeted search phrases, significantly increasing your chances to rank on the first page.

### Your personal guide

After defining the subject of the page you're writing, Focus rates your page on various SEO principles. These principles include subject density, linking, and more.
They help you to see how well you've increased your chances to be ranked higher.

### More topics, more keywords

When your page covers more topics, you should utilize more keywords.
With Focus, you can use three keywords that form three subjects.

Each keyword makes up for a new subject. Focus rates each subject separately.

### It comes with a dictionary

There are many ways to write in a language. With a Premium subscription, you can embrace all Focus has to offer.

So, after you fill in a keyword, Focus connects to our API services and provides you with related synonyms and inflections.
With those, Focus can rate your content more accurately.

The synonyms provided make up for great writing suggestions. Utilizing those synonyms increases your chances to be found, too.

## Usage

[tsfep-bundled]

### Activate Focus

First, you'll need to activate Focus via the Extension Manager's interface.

### Using Focus

On every page with SEO capabilities, you'll find the Audit menu.

Under the audit menu, you can configure Focus for each page.

#### Start getting rated

After you fill in a keyword, Focus starts rating your content.

#### Select lexical form

***(Premium only)***

If your keyword matches an entry in our dictionary, you can select a lexical form.

You should select the form that describes your subject most. The lexical forms are sorted automatically from frequent to infrequent usage.
So, choosing the first form is often correct.

#### Select homonymous example

***(Premium only)***

Some words have more than one meaning. So, after selecting the lexical form, example sentences are formed.
These sentences are also sorted in order of the most common form, and the most common phrase is automatically selected.

Change the example sentence that closely describes your subject, and you could get different synonyms.

#### Select active inflections and synonyms

***(Premium only)***

After all synonyms and inflections are received, just click on the ones you'd like to use.

If you haven't used a synonym in your content yet, consider using it as it will increase your chances of being found.

### Ratings

The ratings tell you what should be improved in your content.

You should never ruin your content just to get a better rating. So, use these ratings as guidelines for focused content.

#### Meta vs Page Title

The page title is what's displayed to the user on your website.
You can change this at the top of your content editor.

The meta title is what's displayed to a potential visitor on Google.
You can change this under the General tab of the page's SEO settings.

#### Introduction

The introduction is often the first few paragraphs of text found in your content editor.
In writing, the first few paragraphs should be used to annotate what your content is about.

It's the best place to use your focus keyword, so users know they've landed on the right page.

A good introduction drastically improves user retention, which indirectly signals that the content is of high quality to search engines.

#### Subject Density

Annotating keywords, inflections, and synonyms more throughout your content is a signal for search engines what your content is about.

When your subject density is too high, your page might seem like spam.

#### Linking

Linking to other pages related to a subject is a powerful signal to search engines which helps them distinguish homonyms.
So, consider adding one or two links related to the subject.

The Focus extension will detect a link when a word is found in the URL, content, or title of an `<a>` tag.

#### Meta description

Meta descriptions don't help in ranking. However, they do help potential visitors to know if the content they're looking for is on your page.

If the subject isn't found in the meta description, Google often tries to fill it in with an (often confusing) sentence from your content.
So, to prevent this from happening, Focus notifies you via this rating.

#### Page URL

One of the best ways to be found on a keyword is by placing it in the page URL. So, be sure to include it here.

You can change your page URL right above the content editor.

## FAQ

### Which languages are supported?

All languages have the requisite support for ratings.

### Which languages are supported by the dictionary API?

The API currently supports English only. Support for other languages will be added over time.

### Why are there only one or two inflections available?

We're currently working on inflection lookups. When it's ready, an update will be sent out.

### "A parsing failure occurred", what does this mean?

When the content parser experiences any error, the rater shows this generic message.
Most likely, your computer may be restraint in processing power in combination with page builders.
This issue resolves automatically, as the parser reassesses its data every 45 seconds, or whenever the related content is updated.

### Are page builders supported?
Focus supports most page builders. However, page builders that rely on shortcodes may give incorrect assessments for the "introduction" and "subject density" ratings.
This is because shortcodes are parsed as readable content, instead of HMTL constructors; the parser is yet unable to discern the shortcode's behavior without context.

These page builders may be affected by this issue:

- Divi Builder
- WPBakery Page Builder (Visual Composer)

These builders work as intended:

- Beaver Builder
- Elementor
- Page Builder by SiteOrigin
- Gutenberg
- WordPress 5.0+ Block Editor

We're working on an update to improve accuracy for the affected page builders.

## Changelog

### 1.3.0

[tsfep-release time="January 28th, 2019"]

* **Added:** The rater now spawns a new processing thread to calculate scores asynchronously.

	* This also means that the thread isn't interfering with tedious and heavy content painting, as such, the performance increased tremendously.
* **Added:** The plugin now tests for and informs on parsing failures.
	* **Note:** A failure fires automatically if the rater is stuck for longer than 30 seconds; this allows your computer to allocate a better core affinity when reattempting. For more information, see the [FAQ](#faq).
* **Improved:** General parsing performance by refactoring HTML tag exclusions, you'll now get results up to ten times quicker, relatively.
* **Improved:** The JS version requirements are upgraded, and as such, all known Unicode punctuation can be excluded correctly.
