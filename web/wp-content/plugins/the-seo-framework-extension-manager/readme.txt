= How it works =

This plugin provides a beautiful and advanced WordPress administrative dashboard page wherein you can activate the latest Free, Essentials, and Premium extensions.

Only the activated extensions are loaded. Other extensions are dormant and the files of those aren’t even touched.

The Premium and Essentials+ extensions can make use of our API services.
The Essentials and Free extensions are completely self-sufficient.

= Privacy =

View our detailed [Plugin Privacy Policy](https://theseoframework.com/privacy-policy/#pluginprivacyinformation).

Do you have questions about privacy? Feel free to [contact us](https://theseoframework.com/contact/).

== Installation ==

= This plugin requires: =

* PHP 5.5.21, 5.6.5, or later. For security and structural reasons.
* WordPress 4.6 or later. For improved AJAX and meta support.
* [The SEO Framework](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/) 2.8 or later. Or it will stay dormant.
* Edge 13, Safari 10, better or equivalent for the best admin experience.
* For improved performance and more available options, your PHP handler should use a 64 bits architecture. 32 bits is also supported.

= Installation instructions: =

1. Download the [latest ZIP file from here](https://dl.theseoframework.com/get/plugin/latest/).
1. Login to your WordPress Dashboard.
1. Go to Plugins > Add New.
1. Click "Upload Plugin" at the top.
1. Upload the `the-seo-framework-extension-manager.zip` file.
1. Either network-activate this plugin or activate it on a single site.
1. That’s it! The plugin will guide you from here.

= This plugin will then guide you through an activation process: =

1. Follow the link provided or go to the Extensions submenu of SEO.
2. Choose your subscription type.
3. That's it! Feel free to activate any extension available.

The extensions test themselves upon activation. So, if any extension doesn't work on your site it will let you know why.

> <strong>The premium software is Open Source:</strong><br>
> This plugin and all extensions within are open source. This means they can be easily altered and shared.<br>
> If you've acquired extensions for The SEO Framework from outside theseoframework.com, they could contain malware.
>
> This also accounts for any other premium software acquired for free. Please, be careful.

= Are you a developer? =
And do you wish to add your own extension to the extension manager? Please contact the plugin author on [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/@cybr/) about your ideas.
A full code review will take place prior to releasing it. The code must pass at least all the WordPress.org plugin guidelines and all code must be licensed under GPLv3.
Feedback and points for improvement will be always given. No monetized nor premium extensions are being accepted, API connections aren't allowed either.

= For developers: Security =
Because this plugin handles multiple input fields, multiple nonce fields had to be created to prevent XSS from otherwise unauthorized users.
To minimize overhead, each nonce type has been supplied an action. This way, the validation all falls under one function.
Many more security techniques, some unprecedented in open source, have been implemented into this plugin.
If you have any questions, before blindly implementing or circumventing security, feel free to contact the plugin author on [Slack](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/@cybr/).

= For developers: Reluctance towards plugin modifications =
This plugin should be compatible with any other plugin or theme, unless they cause PHP errors on their own.
You are allowed to edit this plugin and use hooks on this plugin (as per GPLv3), but any external or internal modification can stop working on any update without prior notice.
This is to enhance the plugin security, stability, and overall performance. Please note that most core functions, classes, methods, and files are shielded against both direct and indirect calls.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this? =
The Extension Manager for The SEO Framework allows you to enable various extensions to enhance your experience and improve your SEO.

= What is The SEO Framework? =
A free SEO plugin, for everyone! Download it [from WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/autodescription/).

= What is an extension? =
An extension is like a plugin, and it can be activated and deactivated on demand. All available extensions, both free and premium, are included in the plugin package.

= Do I need to activate all extensions? =
No. The extensions are tailored for very specific types of websites. Each extension includes carefully crafted documentation, which are linked to on the extensions activation page.

= Do I need to register an account? =
Not at all! This extension manager provides up to date free extensions, without requiring an API connection.

= Does this plugin track my usage? =
Absolutely not! This plugin does not include any user tracking software. We completely rely on your feedback to know what you require.
View our detailed [Plugin Privacy Policy](https://theseoframework.com/privacy-policy/#pluginprivacyinformation) for more information.

= What's the release cycle of extensions? =
Every y.X update (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc.) will include a new extension. Every y.y.X update (1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) fixes bugs and/or adds new functionality to existing extensions. X.y updates (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.) change the plugin's API significantly.

= I've received an error code, what now? =
Follow the steps provided next to the error code, if any. If the error keeps coming back, feel free to [send in an issue](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager/issues/new/choose).

= Which users can activate extensions? =
By default, only users who can manage options can interact with this plugin.

= Where are the extensions acquired from? =
Both free and premium extensions are provided within the plugin package acquired from theseoframework.com.

= Does the Extension Manager need to stay activated to run the extensions? =
Yes. The Extension Manager supplies its own extension activation management system apart from WordPress'.
Deactivating the Extension Manager will also deactivate all extensions.
Most extensions use in-house frameworks embedded in the extension manager, too, like form builders.

= When my subscription expires, what happens? =
When your premium subscription expires, the premium extensions will automatically deactivate.
A margin of error is allowed, so you don't have to worry for when the activation server goes down for an update.

= Does this plugin work on Multisite Networks? =
Absolutely. This plugin can be network activated while The SEO Framework base plugin is activated site-by-site without issues.
Alternatively, this plugin can be activated per site while The SEO Framework is network activated. Any other combination is possible, too.

= Are there WordPress Multisite network specific SEO extensions? =
They're planned! However, there's still a lot to be done before this is even possible.

= What happens when I disconnect my account? =
All plugin settings will be deleted, this includes which extensions were enabled.
Each extension handles its own options (if any); those settings won't be lost, not even upon reactivation of the extension afterwards.

= Does my website support this plugin? =
If it doesn't, it will tell you why. Otherwise, you're good to go! All known issues are correctly labeled with an identification number.
If you were to get a plugin activation error, either open a support ticket [here](https://github.com/sybrew/The-SEO-Framework-Extension-Manager/issues/new/choose) or contact your host and ask them to upgrade PHP to a stable and secure version.
