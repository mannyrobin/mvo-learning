/**
 * A class to house and register all of the Social Warfare - Pro advanced
 * shortcodes for use in posts and widgets (if a widget shortcode plugin is
 * active).
 *
 * This class will loop through all social media networks and register two
 * shortcodes per network for displaying share counts:
 *
 *    A. [network_name_shares] such as [twitter_shares]
 *       This will display the share count, in this case Twitter share counts,
 *       for the current post.
 *
 *    B. [sitewide_network_name_shares] such as [sitewide_twitter_shares]
 *       This will display the share counts, in this case Twitter share counts,
 *       for the entire website. This will add up share counts for all posts,
 *       pages, and custom post types and add them up into one cumalitive total.
 *
 *    C. [total_shares] and [sitewide_total_shares]
 *       These two shortcodes will behave the same as above except that they
 *       will bring out the 'total shares' field instead of an individual
 *       social network.
